**1. Menu-driven Python program.**
   This is a **menu-driven Python program** that lets the user choose different operations from a menu.  
The program greets the user by name, performs tasks like addition, even/odd checking, and palindrome detection,  
and exits with a personalized goodbye message.

Concepts used:  
  - `while True` loops.  
  - `if-elif-else` conditions.  
  - String slicing for palindrome check.  
  - f-strings for formatted output.  

How It Works  
1. The program **asks for your name** once at the start.  
2. A menu of options is displayed in a loop.  
3. You select an option by typing its number.  
4. The program executes the chosen action.  
5. The loop continues until you select **Exit**.
     
**2. Number Guessing Game python program**
    This is a **fun Python number guessing game** where the computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 20**,  
and the player has **3 chances** to guess it.  
The program gives **helpful clues** (single/two-digit, even/odd) after wrong guesses to help you figure it out. 

Concepts used:  
  - `random.randint()` for number generation.  
  - `while` loop for repeated guesses.
  - Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`).  
  - f-strings for formatted messages.

How It Works  
1. The program generates a **random number** between 1 and 20.  
2. The player has **3 attempts** to guess it.  
3. If the guess is wrong, **clues** are given to help.  
4. The game ends when:  
   - The player guesses correctly. 
   - The player runs out of chances.
